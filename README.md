# gh-bell 🔔

A terminal UI for managing GitHub notifications. Built as a `gh` CLI extension.

![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.25-blue)

## Install

```bash
gh extension install cassiomarques/gh-bell
```

## Usage

```bash
gh bell
```

### Authentication

By default, gh-bell inherits authentication from `gh auth login` via the [go-gh](https://github.com/cli/go-gh) library.

If you encounter persistent 502/504 errors from the Notifications API (a known issue with some OAuth tokens), use a [classic GitHub PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) with `notifications` and `repo` scopes:

```bash
# Set the token for a single run
GH_BELL_TOKEN=ghp_your_token gh bell

# Or export it in your shell profile
export GH_BELL_TOKEN=ghp_your_token
```

Token resolution order: `GH_BELL_TOKEN` → `GH_TOKEN` → `GITHUB_TOKEN` → `gh auth login` keyring.

### Configuration

| Environment variable | Description | Default |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| `GH_BELL_TOKEN` | Classic PAT for authentication | (use `gh auth login`) |
| `GH_BELL_REFRESH` | Auto-refresh interval in seconds | `60` |

## Features

- **Vim-style navigation** — `j`/`k`, `gg`/`G` in both list and preview pane
- **Three views** — Unread (`1`), All (`2`), Participating (`3`)
- **Rich filtering** — repo (`/`), title search (`s`), reason (`f`), type (`t`), org (`o`), age (`a`), participating (`p`) — all combinable
- **Full-text search** — `S` searches notification titles, bodies, comments, labels, and more using [Bleve](https://blevesearch.com/)
- **Actions** — `r` mark read, `R` mark all, `m` mute, `u` unsubscribe
- **Open in browser** — `Enter` opens the notification and marks it as read
- **Preview pane** — shows notification details with markdown rendering (via [glamour](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour))
- **Local persistence** — SQLite cache for fast startup + persistent mutes; Bleve index for offline full-text search
- **Remembered preferences** — last active view is restored on next launch
- **New notification indicators** — `•` prefix and green tint for items that appeared since last refresh
- **Color-coded reasons** — each notification reason (review, mention, assign, etc.) has a distinct color
- **Auto-refresh** — configurable polling interval (default 60s, set `GH_BELL_REFRESH`)
- **Notification count** — status bar shows filtered/total count
- **Catppuccin Mocha theme** — beautiful terminal colors out of the box

## How It Works

gh-bell uses the [GitHub Notifications REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/activity/notifications) and inherits authentication from `gh auth login` via the [go-gh](https://github.com/cli/go-gh) library.

Built with [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) v2, following the Elm Architecture (Model → Update → View).

### Data Directory

gh-bell stores local data in `~/.gh-bell/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `meta.db` | SQLite database — cached notifications, thread details, mutes, preferences |
| `search.bleve/` | Bleve full-text search index |
| `gh-bell.log` | Debug log (overwritten each run) |

The cache speeds up startup (cached notifications display instantly while fresh data loads in the background) and enables offline full-text search across notification titles, issue/PR bodies, comments, and labels.

## Development

```bash
go build -o gh-bell .
go test ./...
```
